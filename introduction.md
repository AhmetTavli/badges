A collection of badges designed for personal repositories, and I hope that all of these badges can be widely accepted and used in the document of any project so that they can become more and more standard. If you also have some new ideas about badges, just open an issue. Always remember that: **More than a coder, more than a designer.**

So how to create such cute badges? It's very simple. As it's only registered on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), you should install it by typing:

```bash
sudo npm install -g badges-cli
```

Then you can use this command line tool for creating badges yourself:

```bash
badge -t Alipay -c 1CACEB -p alipay.svg -o output.svg
```

To uninstall the tool, you can just uninstall it by typing:

```bash
sudo npm uninstall -g badges-cli
```

> Note that: because of the problem of text width calculating has not been worked around, it's only supported ASCII characters to generate.
